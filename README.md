# Candy Crush
https://lavinia-81.github.io/Candy-crush/

Welcome to the **Candy-Crush** game repository! This project contains the code for a classic match-three puzzle game, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game board and elements.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Adds the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with a grid of candies.
3. Drag and drop candies to match three or more of the same color in a row or column.
4. Matched candies will be cleared, and new candies will fall into place.
5. Your score will increase based on the number of candies matched.
6. The game continues until no more matches are possible.

## Key Concepts

- **Game Logic**: Implemented in JavaScript to handle candy matching, scoring, and updating the game state.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game looks great on all devices.
- **Event Handling**: Uses JavaScript to add events to elements for a dynamic user experience.
